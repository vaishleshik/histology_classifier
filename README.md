# histology_classifier
A machine learning model to label histologic images

Okay this is a little ambitious. We want to develop something which can have a look at a histologic section and tell which tissue it is (skin/ liver/ lung/ kidney etc). 

## Training data

Training data is in the folder final_data_randomised/train

## Validation data

Training data is in the folder final_data_randomised/val


## Objective

Come up with a machine learning model multi class classifier (whatever you prefer) which can perform with 70% accuracy on this same training data.
